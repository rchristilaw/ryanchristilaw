If you're reading this, I've decided to create a blog, partly for self organization of ideas, partly for self promotion, partly for sharing tips and mistakes that I've encountered during dev work, and mostly as a news platform for Props Buddy updates. Bonus points for finally finding a use for ryanchristilaw.com that has been sitting idle for over a year.

I wanted something easy and free to setup this blog. After evaluating several options, I decided to go with Jekyll hosted on my Github Pages, which checked the boxes on several desired features, to name just a few:
- Free to host (using Github Pages)
- Freedom and fully customizable. I didn't want to drag and drop components onto the page, I want to learn a bit from building this.
- Lightweight (for when I have millions of daily readers)
- Quick to set up (I wanted something up an running within hours, not days/weeks/months)

So I followed [this tutorial][jekyll-tutorial] to get it up and running and here we are. Stayed tuned for future posts!
