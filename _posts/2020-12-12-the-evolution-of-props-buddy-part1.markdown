# Super Bowl XLVIII - February 2, 2014
The first SuperBowl watch party (post undergrad). This super bowl and the subsequent Superbowls until 2017, the props competition was barebones. Each guest receives their prop sheet upon entry and have until just before kickoff to fill out their props. Upon completion of the game, participants would pass their prop sheets to the person to their left (just like in grade school) and we would mark the prop sheets as a group. By the time the game ended, the boys were so full of pulled pork, chicken wings and beer that they just wanted to get home and marking the props for some was a chore (especially if they knew their ticket had been busted since the first quarter).
